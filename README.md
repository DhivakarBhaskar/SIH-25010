## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Using Drone Techonolgy</h3>
<p>The proposed Smart Crop Advisory System empowers small and marginal farmers by enabling easy access to personalized, real-time crop care guidance using a missed call–activated drone system. Farmers simply give a missed call to a dedicated number, which automatically activates an autonomous drone deployed to their farm. This drone is equipped with advanced soil sensors, weather monitoring devices, and imaging cameras to collect comprehensive data on soil type, moisture levels, prevailing weather conditions, and crop health. The process requires zero smartphone use or internet connectivity, making it highly accessible even for resource-constrained farmers.</p>
<p>Once the drone collects field data, it transmits this information securely to a cloud-based AI engine. The AI analyzes the integrated data along with the farmer’s crop history to generate precise recommendations tailored to the specific field conditions. These advisories include the ideal type and quantity of fertilizers, irrigation schedules, and pest management solutions to optimize crop yield and ensure sustainable farming practices. To overcome language barriers and literacy challenges, the system converts the recommendations into the farmer’s local language and communicates them through automated voice calls and SMS messages, ensuring clear understanding and prompt action.</p>
<p>This innovative solution bridges technology gaps faced by smallholder farmers by combining drone-enabled accurate data collection with a simple initiation method through missed calls. It reduces dependency on smartphones and internet, provides timely and location-specific crop care advice, and enhances farmers’ decision-making capacity. With scalability and cost-effectiveness, this system aims to improve agricultural productivity, reduce input waste, and ultimately increase the income and livelihoods of small and marginal farmers across diverse regions</p>

## Technical Approach

<p>The technical approach for the missed call–activated drone-based Smart Crop Advisory System combines autonomous aerial data collection with cloud-based artificial intelligence and multilingual communication. When a farmer gives a missed call to a dedicated number, it triggers the deployment of an autonomous drone equipped with advanced soil sensors and imaging cameras. The drone navigates the field, collecting real-time data on soil characteristics, moisture levels, crop health, and local weather conditions. This rich dataset is then transmitted securely to a cloud platform designed to handle large-scale data processing and storage. The use of drones enables detailed and timely monitoring of farm conditions, overcoming the limitations of manual data collection and ensuring precision agriculture practices.</p>
<p>In the cloud backend, machine learning models analyze the incoming data combined with the farmer’s crop history and environmental factors. These models generate personalized recommendations related to fertilizer usage, irrigation scheduling, and pest management, tailored specifically to the field’s conditions. To make this information usable by farmers with diverse linguistic and literacy backgrounds, the system automatically translates the recommendations into the local language and delivers them via voice calls and SMS alerts. This communication strategy ensures accessibility even without smartphones or internet connectivity. The overall architecture supports scalability, automation, and cost-efficiency, aiming to democratize advanced crop advisory services for small and marginal farmers.</p>

## Feasibility and Viability

<p>The feasibility of the missed call-activated drone-based Smart Crop Advisory System is supported by the growing technological advances and increased accessibility of drones in agriculture. Drones today are equipped with sophisticated soil sensors, multispectral cameras, and environmental monitors, enabling detailed and precise data collection remotely. The low-cost activation method via missed call makes this technology accessible to farmers without smartphones or internet, overcoming a significant barrier in rural and resource-constrained settings. Additionally, cloud computing and AI provide scalable and efficient processing of the vast data received, ensuring quick turnaround for personalized advisory generation.
From a viability perspective, this approach aligns well with current trends in precision agriculture and government initiatives supporting drone usage in farming. The cost savings from reduced manual labor, optimized use of fertilizers, and better pest and water management contribute to increased farm productivity and profitability, making it economically sustainable. Furthermore, providing advisories in local languages through voice calls and SMS enhances user adoption and impact. With state-level drone policies and existing pilot projects demonstrating benefits, this system has strong potential for implementation and scaling among small and marginal farmers, ultimately improving their livelihoods and farming sustainability.</p>
